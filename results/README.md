# Results

46 JSON files + 5 parquet + 9 figures. All pre-computed by the analysis pipeline.

## File naming convention

- `a*` -- descriptive statistics (platform stats, temporal, owners, threads)
- `b*` -- signal computation (temporal, content, naming, owner, triangulation)
- `c*` -- content structure (topics, replies, diversity, depth gradient)
- `d*` -- coordination detection (batch, karma, timing)
- `e*` -- natural experiment (restart composition, drift, convergence)
- `f*` -- network formation (first contact, bridges, evolution, clusters)
- `p*` -- phenomena (myth genealogy, skill vs organic, echo decay, super-commenters)
